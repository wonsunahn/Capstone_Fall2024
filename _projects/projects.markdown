## Behavior, Fairness, and Safety in Traffic Control
In recent years, several studies have proposed different methods and formulations for the Traffic Signal Control problem, presenting promising results and flexible traffic light solutions. Some of the studies investigate technical AI aspects (e.g., different neural network architectures, transfer learning, RL models, etc.) and the coordination problem (e.g., distributed systems), while others are interested in the implementation side of things (e.g., Systems/IoT), just to name a few of the interests within the Computer Science realm.

For this project, the focus is to verify how adaptive systems handle not only efficiency (e.g., minimize time loss) but also other important aspects of traffic control, namely, behavior changes in traffic flow due to expected and unexpected events, fairness between the different actors of the system, and safety (e.g., accidents prevention).

For the capstone project, we want you to focus on one specific aspect of Traffic Control: Emergency Vehicles.
- Prioritize Emergency Vehicles (e.g., EMS vehicles) in the street network by preempting the traffic lights and adding virtual lanes so EMVs can arrive at their destination quickly and safely.
- At the end of the semester, you will produce a conference-like paper, which we intend/plan to submit.

We are looking for self-motivated, independent individuals interested in real-world problems. Being comfortable programming Python is indispensable since you will work with pre-existing (and extensive) code, interact with the traffic simulator (Sumo), run experiments, and plot graphs. Interest in doing research is differential since you will write and read about it. Interest in RL is desirable but knowledge is not required.

## Connecting Indigenous Knowledge

[More information]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/pdfs/Connecting_Indigenous_Knowledge-CS_Capstone.pdf)

Around the world, many cultures are significantly threatened by the erosion of cultural integrity, climate change, loss of habitat, the environmental impact of globalization, and the ravages of epidemics. Cultures that do not have a strong written tradition are especially threatened – as younger generations move away in search of education and jobs, and as globalization forces linguistic shifts to more “global” languages such as English and Spanish, rich oral traditions either disappear completely or become artifacts in university or library archives, accessible only to small groups of academics.  Many initiatives have been activated to preserve and revitalize indigenous cultures, traditions, and languages. While quite a few of these initiatives involve the use of computational technologies and multimedia to document and archive indigenous languages, knowledge, and cultures, much of what has been created to date is primarily designed to serve academic communities and does not provide access to either the broader public (e.g., anyone who wishes to learn about a particular culture) or to the indigenous communities that provided the data in the first place. Moreover, existing systems tend to focus on a single corpus of stories and do not provide possibilities to connect and map stories, characters, and concepts across multiple cultures and languages.


We propose to develop StoryWorlds ITK (Indigenous Traditional Knowlege Worlds), an open-source web-based system for collecting, storing, connecting, and presenting Indigenous traditional knowledge (ITK) in the form of stories, myths, and testimonies from multiple cultures and languages.  Moreover, the proposed system will allow users to connect ITK narratives based on topics, characters, environments, storylines, and other criteria (e.g., a particular animal appears in X stories from X cultures and acts as a positive character in X of the stories and as a negative character in the remaining X stories).


The proposed system will offer three sets of user interfaces (UIs): (1) a UI for academic users (i.e., anthropologists, linguists, botanists, ornithologists, and traditional knowledge specialists to support the uploading of stories, field notes, and associated media, concept mapping, and creation of ontologies; (2) a text-based search UI to allow any user (but especially younger indigenous users) to search through stories using multiple combinations of keywords and concept and present results in text-based or tabular format; (3) a graph-based search UI to allow any user to search through stories using multiple combinations of keywords and concept and present results as an interactive visual network of concepts.


Visualizing and exploring  ITK with knowledge graphs can provide a new perspective on traditional stories and their themes, motifs, and characters. Techniques such as network analysis, tree maps, and sentiment analysis can reveal patterns and relationships within  ITK that might otherwise be overlooked. For example, network analysis can uncover the relationships between the characters in a story, while sentiment analysis can help identify the emotions associated with them. Graph-based approaches to oral traditions can also be useful in comparative studies across cultures or time periods. Research into representing oral literature with knowledge graphs can uncover unique insights into traditional stories and their cultural significance.  Imagine, for example, if any member of the public could quickly compare the role of a coyote in relation to various plants and animals along with key emotions evoked by a coyote across different languages of the US and Mexico.  Imagine also that indigenous experts within those various traditions could upload new versions they had heard.   A much more nuanced animal character might emerge than might be simply captured by the reductive category “trickster”.

## Nadine

## Daniel Mosse projects

1 - Hyperparameter Optimization (applied to machine-learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)): This area is directed towards the automated selection and tuning of hyperparameters in an effort to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of intrusion detection systems based on machine-learning methods.
2 - Explainable Artificial Intelligence - XAI (applied to machine-learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)): This subject deals with the development of machine-learning models that are not just effective, but are also transparent and interpretable. The goal is to create IDSs that users can not only trust but also understand.

### Basic Requirements:
- Programming Proficiency: Applicants should possess a reasonable level of proficiency in Java or Python.
- Machine Learning Familiarity: Familiarity with, or an interest and willingness to QUICKLY learn as guided how to use, machine learning libraries is essential.

### Flexible Application:
We are open to adapting the project to explore Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) or Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) in educational data mining contexts or applications rather than IDSs.

### International experience: the co-advisor, Silvio E. Quincozes, is a Brazilian researcher at the Federal University of Pampa (UNIPAMPA):
Students also have the unique opportunity to collaborate on a project with the Federal University of Pampa in Brazil. They have a project (XAIID - Intelligent and Explainable Strategies for Intrusion Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems) that focuses on intelligent and explainable strategies for intrusion detection in cyber-physical systems. Participants will not only gain valuable international research experience but will also be awarded a certificate of completion for their contributions to the XAIID project.

## Virtual dashboard to manage SCI rooms and inventory
This project will aim at creating a new equipment inventory management/loaner management page for SCI.
Current system is OLD and not great! For example, it can only be used for Sennott. And we want to replace it with one that expands its functionality and embraces whole SCI

It will include:
    - a per room equipment management view,
    - graphic representation of network ports, and equipment location

* Team Size: 2/3 students
* POC: Matheus Barbosa (matheus.lb@gmail.com)

## Virtual Billboards for the CS department

This project wants to create a webpage to expand the current ‘What do you want’ lists on our murals.
Including SCI Ideas/projects/suggestions/wiki page

Its users (Students, staff, and faculty) can submit ideas for projects improvements. Then a curator role would moderate suggestions (just to avoid trash and abuse!) and make them public.

Ideas/projects can be rated, up-voted (so SCI and departments can prioritize implementation when viable).
And once the projects are selected for implementation, SCI community can track their status.

Posters need to be created to advertise the page.

## Luis Oliveira projects - ONLY 2 out of these 3!

### Measuring performance losses of a userspace traffic controller
In this project we will be implementing a non-workconserving network-traffic scheduler in the Linux kernel and measure its performance when compared to a user-space implementation.

You'll need to learn about eBPF (extended Berkley Packet Filters) [Timing? What's timing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_EehoXLbIU), and how to use them to instrument the execution of the code. Then, you'll run experiments to measure the impact on communitacition latency and bandwidth.

Then, we'll look into netlink sockets (a mechanism to communicate with a kernel space program) to reconfigure the scheduler. If there is time, we will use this to implment a traffic scheduler.
- Skills:
    - Must have taken CS1550!
    - Be confortable with C

* Team Size: 2/3 students
* POC: Luís Oliveira (loliveira@pitt.edu)

### Create an Android ROS2-based controller to interface with a robot
Question: can we easily run ROS2 from Android?
Answer: That's what you'll have to figure out! :)

In this project, you will be tasked to research ways of interfacing with the ROS2 middleware (commonly used in robotics) from Android. There are some libraries in the wild; but I don't know how to use them. Of if/how they work at all. So, first task, look into those and see if/how they work.

Second task, make an interface to remote control some robots by sending messages. Which may require programming some robots!

Then, we'll look into netlink sockets (a mechanism to communicate with a kernel space program) to reconfigure the scheduler. If there is time, we will use this to implment a traffic scheduler.
- Skills:
    - Should have an android phone (I can lend you 1 if needed be)
    - Be confortable with Java (Android), and C (Android/ROS2)

* Team Size: 2/3 students
* POC: Luís Oliveira (loliveira@pitt.edu)

### RF-based ranging - Running Round-Trip Time-of-flight for locatization
I have [these boards](https://www.qorvo.com/products/p/DWM3001CDK). They are development kit that are equipped with hardware that can measure distance based on the time wireless signals take to travel between 2 devices.

In this project, you will be tasked to learn how to use them! :)
This will require [digging into some datasheets and application notes](https://www.qorvo.com/products/p/DWM3001CDK#documents), and possibly some soldering (I can help :).

Once we are able to use the devices, we will build a simple application that can estimate the relative positions of these devices! Using a well known technique to convert distances into positions.

- Skills:
    - Should be confortable with C!
    - Experience with embedded systems is good, but not needed (you can learn!)

## Dashboard to manage the Involvement and Student Unions units
The department of Involvement and Student Unions is a newly imagined area within Student Affairs. It has taken the place of what was Student Life. This departments mission is to Magnify mattering through Place, Space & Activities. Unlike most departments within Student Affairs, this area is composed a of a number different units, The Student Unions, The Pitt Program Council, PITT ARTS, Technical Services, and the Student Organizations Resource Center (SORC). Each of these areas have distinct deliverables, cultures, and financial systems with staff members with varying degrees of financial knowledge.

The challenge is multileveled. The first is to understand the financial spending approach of each area so that a local version of a tracking tool can be created rightsized for the unit. The second is to create a unified centralized system that can support each unique area while providing a summary dashboard that can tabulate and provide comparative data live to the director. Third is the ability to integrate spending goals related to diversity and sustainability.

## AI for Surgical Research

Project Background

The University of Pittsburgh produces some of the highest quantity and quality surgical research in the country, if not world. Although many breakthroughs come from basic/translational research, clinical research primarily drives our fields forward at a steady pace. This type of research can be anything from retrospective studies based on prior patients’ charts (colloquially named “chart reviews”) to systematic reviews to generate best-practices to randomized control trials for novel treatments or techniques. However, there is an incredible amount of tedium that is involved in generating each research project.

AI poses the possibility to reduce that tedium, as well as increase efficiency, and produce more and higher-quality research. Given the ease of using and developing upon available generate AI APIs, we are interested in creating tools to improve our research.

Project Summary In this project, students will work on developing and testing one or multiple tools to further the research capabilities of multiple surgical departments, Neurosurgery, Craniofacial and Pediatric Plastic Surgery, Orthopedic Surgery to start with. Our desired tools include developing an app to create outlines and comprehensive literature “pulls” for systematic review generation, an app that allows for training a model based on a user’s previous writing in order to have “personalized” editing and writing suggestions, and an app that generates high-quality medical images that can be used in publications. There are additional similar projects if there is time or a desire for future work. IP and NDA agreements will be discussed.

Project Goals

  - Evaluate most useful publicly available LLM for our purposes

  - Develop desktop or web apps as above

  - Stretch goal – bring the multiple apps above into one multi-functional app that can allow for further functionality to be built on top in future iterations

Team

  - 2-4 students

  - Nicolás Kass, Craniofacial and Pediatric Plastic Surgery Research Fellow and Co-Director of Medical Research, Surreality Lab (Primary)

  -  Dr. Ted Andrews, Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery, Founder and Director of Surreality Lab (secondary)
